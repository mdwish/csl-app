			<h2>What lists are included in the U.S. Department of Commerce's Consolidated Screening List (CSL)?</h2>
			<p>The Consolidated Screening List (CSL) is a comprehensive list of parties that are restricted or prohibited from participating in certain activities or transactions due to legal or regulatory reasons. It is maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) and is intended to assist U.S. companies in conducting denied party screening.</p>
			<p>The CSL includes a variety of lists and databases, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Denied Persons List (DPL): This list includes parties that are subject to U.S. economic and trade sanctions due to their involvement in activities such as terrorism, weapons proliferation, and human rights abuses.</li>
				<li>The Entity List: This list includes parties that are restricted from receiving certain goods or technologies due to national security or other concerns. It includes companies, individuals, and other organizations that have been identified as a risk due to their involvement in activities such as nuclear proliferation, missile technology proliferation, or other activities that could pose a threat to U.S. national security or foreign policy.</li>
				<li>The Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List: This list includes parties that are subject to U.S. economic and trade sanctions due to their involvement in activities such as terrorism, weapons proliferation, and other illicit activities. It includes individuals, companies, and other organizations that are owned or controlled by, or act on behalf of, a party that is subject to U.S. sanctions.</li>
				<li>The Unverified List (UVL): This list includes parties that the BIS has been unable to verify as being eligible to receive certain goods or technologies due to a lack of sufficient information.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The CSL is updated on a regular basis and is available to the public for free on the BIS website. It is intended to assist U.S. companies in complying with export control regulations and avoiding transactions with parties that are restricted or prohibited from participating in certain activities.</p>
