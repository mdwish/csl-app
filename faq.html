			<h2>What lists are included in the U.S. Department of Commerce's Consolidated Screening List (CSL)?</h2>
			<p>The Consolidated Screening List (CSL) is a comprehensive list of parties that are restricted or prohibited from participating in certain activities or transactions due to legal or regulatory reasons.
